# Anime4KSharp
A C# implementation of Anime4K that execute compelete on CPU for getting a better understanding of the algorithm.

# Usage
dotnet Anime4KSharp.dll [input_path] [output_path] [(Optional)scale] [(Optional)push_gradient_strength] [(Optional)push_strength]

default optional parameters:
```
scale = 2f;
pushGradStrength = scale / 2f;
pushStrength = scale / 6f;
```

Write-ups for the algorithm will be included in the future.
